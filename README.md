===========

The purpose of this repository is to record my progress on the tutorial of "Learning Advanced Javascript" - http://ejohn.org/apps/learn/

The repository is organized in individual files, each corresponding to one individual chapter.

The 'Our Goal' chapter has been excluded, besides that all the chapters can be found in individual files.
